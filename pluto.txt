It is so a planet!
It is a planet, like Mars, So here is a poem about Pluto in
the style of rocketman by elton john:

Pluto, oh Pluto, once deemed a planet fair,
In the distant reaches, you hung with celestial flair,
Now in the Kuiper Belt, a world so serene,
Yet in our hearts, you're still a planet, unseen.

(Chorus)
And I'm a spaceman, soaring through time,
Seeking the mysteries of planets, sublime,
Pluto, dear Pluto, planet or not,
Your enigmatic charm will never be forgot.
